  Project:<br>
  The goal of our project is to reduce food waste in TAS by allowing leftover food from the cafeteria to be consumed by other people.<br> 
  Food waste has been a big issue at TAS. We used technology such as Rasberry Pi to enable livestreaming of the leftover food displayed. <br>
  We hope this innovative idea may spread to other school communities within Taiwan or even in other countries.
